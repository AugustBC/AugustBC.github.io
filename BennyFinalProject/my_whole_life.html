Through out my life, I have experience many different things out there. I also attened to school, it was alot of fun, but also I faced many different types of challenges out there. It wasn't easy at frist, I have to practice and study that I was able to know my skills, but not only that I still needed help just to make sure I got it right. And I did learned alot from my teachers and my people, that made me the parson today. But not only I love school, I also love Vedio Games so much that I still play vedio games till this day. When I was child, my uncle was the one who show me vedio games, right after that I was so hook that everyday after school when I was finish with my school work/homework, i'll go to my uncle room and play vedio game befor I have to go to bed. Since then when I fell in love of vedio games, I decied to become a vedio game designer, and so today that why i'm am here in BMCC.</p>
