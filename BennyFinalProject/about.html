	<p class="me3">Through out my life I have meat tons of people. Unfortunately, the people have came and gone over time they will never be forgotten. Some of the people were cool, some were like you want to rip your hair off, and some were like they are just there. But all that of meeting those people were like family to me. And couldn't ask any better then that!</p>
